### How to use and What to expect from this app

- I am using two different openweathermap Apis. 
 1) To get One particular location current weather report. (First page where you can see userInput box and a button). when you add a valid zip code. I made a network call in order to retrive the particular location's weather and display on the view along the map with drop pin with title of the place and current temperature. 
    - This is the landing page of the app. There is segment control which changes between degree Fahrenheit and degree Celcius. 
    - There is a sharing button on the bottom right cornor on this page where you can share twitter post about the current weather details and share photo to your facebook account. 
    - You can take a photo on an iOS device (iPhone or iPad) or choose one from the photo library and make that photo as a blurred background on the page. 
    - Whenever you enter the zip code and search using search button, your location is saved on an array by the help of NSUserDefaults and persisted. Later when you tap on searchbox, you search history along with city and country is shown on the tableView. 
    - If you want to delete those address, you can swipe right that particuler cell and delete. It will be deleted from persisted array and also on the NSUserDefaults.


 2) To get current users location weather report for 7 days in a custom tableview with tableViewHeader of customized date format. This is a Second page when you click "current weather" on navigation bar on firstViewcontroller.
