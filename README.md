# Code Challenge
A list of tricks and tips for iOS programming

##The assignment
Write an application that:
● Allows the user to add a zip code to a table / list
● Allows the user to select a zip code and see the current temperature using the OpenWeatherMap API
● Shows the location on a map with the current temperature in the map pin
● Allows the user to set a preference for ºC or ºF



#### Additional functionality (Optional)
● Allow the user to select `Current Location` that automatically adds the current zip code to the list
● Persist the user’s list of cities
● Show a 5-day list of high and low temperatures
● Post a tweet about the current weather (for iOS, use Apple’s Social Framework; for Android, use an Implicit Intent)
● Take a photo that overlays the current temperature on a corner
● Save the photo to the user’s library
● Share the photo with Facebook (for iOS, use Apple’s Social Framework; for Android, use an Implicit Intent)
● Show other weather information (e.g. cloudiness, humidity)
